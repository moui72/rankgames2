# Rank Games 2

This app is intended to help you build ranked lists of games from those in your collection on [Board Game Geek](http://boardgamegeek.com). Total rewrite of my previous [RankGames app](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1442306/game-ranking-tool). Performance should be much improved, and I think the animations really help usability.

Built with [VueJS](http://vuejs.org), [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) and [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/).
